# My version of Bamzooka website

## Description

Hello, I'm learning how to use **Bootstrap efficiently**. My first job is to redo the existing **Bamzooka Web Page** (https://bamzooka.com/) with my tools: **HTML, CSS, PHP, Bootstrap**. Then I must host it on **Firebase**. 

## Installation

- First install **PHP**:
```bash
sudo apt install php
```
- Then install **Apache**:
```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2
```
- Finally install the **Firebase CLI**:
```bash
curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
```
NB: For more details about Firebase configuration, see: https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart .

## Getting Started

### with Apache:

Put your website folder in the following repertory: `/var/www/html` .

### with Firebase hosting:

Go to your repertory above `src` and `images`  and type:
```bash
firebase init hosting
```
Then follow the instructions.

## Usage

- To edit the code, go to the `src` folder, and then you can modify either the header(`header.php`), footer(`footer.php`), or the main page (`index.php`).

- To add logos or images, put them in the `images` folder.
 
- To see your changes, deploy your website in local either with PHP or with Apache. To do this, read the `Deployment` section below.

- When your website is ready to be shown to the World Wide Web, put the `src` and `images` folders in the `public` folder.

## Deployment

I did three ways of deployment (2 locals and 1 global):

### local with PHP: 

1. First start the PHP server in the repertory above `src` and `images` by typing in a shell:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
2. Then go to your browser and type in the URL : http://localhost:8000/src .

3. Finally, after finishing working, to stop the PHP server, do Ctrl-C.

### local with Apache:

1. First start the Apache server by typing in a shell one of the 3 following commands: 
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
```
```bash
sudo service apache2 start
```
or via systemd for Debian/Ubuntu Linux users:
```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2.service
```

2. Then go to your browser and type in the URL: `http://{ipAdress}/{repertory}`
 where:
- {ipAdress} is your IP address;
- {repertory} is the path name of your repertory containing `index.php` within the `/var/www/html` folder.

- NB1: To know your IP address, you can type in a shell: 
```bash
 hostname -I
```
Your IP address is the first group of numbers.

- NB2: If you want to write a **specific URL** (e.g. `pharaohofparis.com`) to have your localhost website (instead of `http://{ipAdress}/{repertory}`), do the following:
1.  Go to the repertory `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` and create a new file named `pharaohofparis.com.conf` in which you must insert:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName pharaohofparis.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/{repertory}

    <Directory /var/www/html/{repertory}>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
2.  Activate the virtual host by typing:
```bash
sudo a2ensite pharaohofparis.com.conf
sudo service apache2 reload
```
3.  Edit the `/etc/hosts` file by adding the line:
```
127.0.0.1       pharaohofparis.com
```

3. Finally, after finishing working, to stop the Apache server, type:
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
```
```bash
sudo service apache2 stop
```
or via systemd for Debian/Ubuntu Linux users:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop apache2.service
```
### global with Firebase:

1. After finishing working in local, to deploy the website in global on Firebase, type:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

2. Then go to your browser and type in the URL one of the 2 following URL:
- https://bamzooka-copy.web.app/
- https://bamzooka-copy.firebaseapp.com/

NB: If your work hasn't changed, you don't need to do the first step the next time you want to see your website.
